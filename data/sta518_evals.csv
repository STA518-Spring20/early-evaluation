I only mean to write like 3 times a week, the other 2 are just things to get the grade. Also, the grading of the learning journal I think isn't the best, because it is kind of subjective and there is no way to refute those grades. Even when I truly mean what I'm writing down, I got a P, and it is kind of frustrating. Because the name gives me the impression that is more than just a grade, its a way of expressing yourself with thoughts, issues, or solutions you found.","I'm in favor or the Learning journal, it's a great tool, but I would change it's grading.",NA

In class it would be fine but for an online class it takes away the flexibility I wanted to gain from online coursework. I will admit though that my group has helped me understand things a few times.,I stopped taking notes and copying examples of syntax into a google doc. I often struggle with syntax and it can be easy to forget little tricks so I should get back to that.,The course is interesting. I like the material and I am learning a lot.

I'm not sure how much I'm actually getting out of the task, but it doesn't feel like it is enhancing my learning.  It feels somewhat like a daily task that can get in the way of learning at times.","I need to figure out a way to devote more time to class work during the week, when it is most difficult for my schedule.  I plan to commit to completing at least some course work every day of the week, and have been on track for this for at least a week now.","I love learning and working with code.  I do feel a little overwhelmed with the time I am dedicating sometimes, and am fearful how I will hold up after 11 weeks.  I thought spring and summer terms were 7-8 weeks, so 7 more weeks without any breaks of devoting every spare minute of my day to course work seems daunting and feels like a  heavy weight now."

Though i wish the live sessions had more focus on how to do things.,"Less work load, I currently feel overburdened. Lessen the work load a bit. I am relatively new to the whole understanding programming and having 4 assignments a week, plus learning journals  is quite tough to keep up. Some people still have jobs that are 40 plus a week. I have spend several hours after work doing the readings, taking notes, and attempting to get the assignments done on time.  Another thing would be maybe some more notes from the professor, or examples that will help direct where i am learning. Things that will help in the activities and focus on the aspects the professor wants us to solidify.",Idk better time management. It just feels like so many hours are being put into this class.,NA

I do not have time every day to go and look up stuff on R and write about how great it is. I'm paying for this course to teach me, not to go out and find resources myself if I wanted to teach myself R I would, instead I'd like for someone who has the experience to teach me, not stack overflow or  some blog post from several years ago. If the journals were discussion boards with questions about the material to make sure we're caught up instead would make more sense.",Nothing. We have the collaborate sessions and the git-hub issues posts as resources to ask questions but they don't conform well to any additional or improved learning they just can answer questions.,"The way that the class is set up is completely different than any other online class I have had. With no lectures being posted and learning being done nearly completely independently .Because of this the workload is much greater than any other course, even compared to my other summer class which is a six week class instead of the eleven. Also with the way the classes grading is set up on the mastery system currently I feel like the turn around times for resubmitting is too short, between all the activities, applications, journals, readings, videos, and the projects on top of other obligations I and my classmates have the time to do the resumbissions is too short.  This goes against the point of the system which is to make sure you understand the material to a reasonable degree by resubmitting work and receiving feedback on what to improve. The long and the short of it is that the way this course is currently set up is more like an independent study than a lecture course, and I signed up for a lecture and discussion course on ""Statistical Computing and Graphics with R""  not here's the book, read it, do this assignment then ask questions if you need help."

I'm also glad the the assignments cover different methods of achieving the similar results. So modifying the code we've written already helps show the nuances problem.

Working in a team has helped me as an R programmer by getting help and offering guidance.","I feel the learning journal requirement is too high. The average weekly journal entries for a (+) is an accepted submission for more than half of the days in the week (44/11). The minimum average to be above the threshold for (-) is more than the class sessions (22). 

Most of my work is on the two class session days, so coming up with quality journal entries on other days of the week.

One way I would change the minimum for a (-) to be as many times as class is held (22) and for a (+) to be the number of times class is held a week +1 (33). 
Another is to approve quality participation on the community site.",I plan on starting the reading earlier than the day of the assignment. This will balance my class work on more days.,"I really like the github classroom experience. However, is it possible to create one repo for each student and one repo for each team where the assignments are the first level folders? It's hard to navigate on github now with all the repos showing on my sidebar with projects aside from this class."
